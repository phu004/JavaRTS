# JavaRTS
Hobby project, trying to create a simple RTS game with somewhat challenging AI using Pure Java. 
Feel free to grab anything you want here, including the source code and image files! 


**Some features about the AI:**

1. AI does not cheat, its vision are limited by fog of war, and it doesn't have any advantage in resource gathering.
2. AI will send scout unit to look for player's bases and figure out player's army composition. It will use this info to change its own 
   army composition, and make decisions on when and where to attack (normal/hard difficulty).
3. AI will expand to a different mining location when the current one is running low.
4. During battle, AI will pick off weakened player units first (hard difficulty). 
5. During travelling AI units will wait for each other to avoid being scattered all over the map (normal/hard difficulty). 
6. AI will retreat when it lost a significant number of units (normal/hard difficulty).
7. Send units to partol the outer parameter of the base, so AI can deal with player's sneak attack eariler (hard difficulty).
8. When ecnounter a concentrated player static defences, use long range units to deal with the static defence while keep 
   other units in safe distance (hard difficulty).

**How to run the game:**
